        <p class="article-content">Dear Participant,
            
            You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide if you want to take part, please take time to read carefully the following information.
            
            This study is interested in the factors that impact memory and well-being in an ageing population. We are particularly interested in how memory might differ in different cultures. The study will investigate your general memory, well-being and will ask questions on how you view the culture you live in.
            
            It is up to you to decide if you wish to take part in this study. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time without having to give a reason. If at any time you do not wish to continue with the study, then simply click the withdrawal button or close the screen.
            
            The study involves questions about yourself and how you feel. It also includes some memory and thinking skills tasks. If you choose to take part, you will be given full written instructions throughout to help you complete the study on your own. However, if you have any questions you can email the researcher too. All the information will be collected anonymously, so you will never be asked for any identifiable information, such as your name or date of birth.
            
            If you choose to take part, then please read all the instructions carefully. We imagine the whole study will take you about 30 minutes to complete. However, this may differ from person to person. The memory and thinking skills tasks are deliberately designed to be a bit challenging, so do not worry if you find them difficult – just try your best to complete them in the best way you can.
             
            This study will not directly benefit you in anyway, but you will be contributing to our understanding of how memory is different in different cultures in an ageing population. This could help generate interventions to prevent memory decline in older adults.
             
            The only people that will be aware of your participation will be members of the research team at BPP University.
             
            All information that is collected during the study will be kept confidential at all times and in compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018. If there is a possibility of participant information being disclosed to others it will because the participant states their intentions to harm themselves or others. All information will also be anonymised and participant identity will remain private.
             
            All records from the study will be stored on a password protected computer and only the research team will have access to these records.
             
            Following the completion of the project. The collective results of all the participants in the study will be analysed and the findings will be written up to form the student researcher’s MSc dissertation. We may choose to publish our findings in a scientific journal and/or conference.
             
            If you have any questions about the research before deciding to take part or need guidance with taking part in the research, then please contact the student researcher, Rebecca Sarah Jaya Sudhir: r.jaya@my.bpp.com .
             
            This study has been co-ordinated by BPP University Psychology Department and ethically approved by the BPP University Research Ethics Committee.
             
            If you wish to make a complaint or have any questions after the study has ended, then please contact:
            Dr Sara Balouch (Student’s Supervisor): sarabalouch@bpp.com
            Professor Adrian Hunnisett (BPPU Research Director): adrianhunnisett@bpp.com
